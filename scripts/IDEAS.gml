locking one of the input numbers
locking the sign
using all the signs

number recharge
sign recharge

after you destroy or reset an input number keep it selected
make it so that you can cycle through each input (num1, to sign, to num2, back to num1 or to the answer)
BETTER IDEA: 
have the cycle through feel like a calculator. (press first num, then press symbol, then press second num, then enter)
